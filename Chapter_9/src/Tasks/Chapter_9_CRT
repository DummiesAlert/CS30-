1. What index value does the third element of an array have?

		The index value value that the third element of an array is 2 because it's the third section of the 
		array since its goes from 0 ,1 then to 2.  
		
2. Write the declaration for an array named quantities that stores 20 integers.

		Int[20] quantities;
		
3. Write a declaration for an array named heights storing the numbers 1.65, 2.15, and 4.95.

		double[] heights = {1.65, 2.15, 4.95};
		
4. Write a for-each statement that displays the integer values stored in an array named grades.

		For (String element: grades)

		{

			System.out.println(element);

		}

5. 

	a) Write an algorithm for inserting data into an array so that existing data is moved up one position to 
	   make room for the new data.

		for((int i = 0; i < Object.width;i ++))

		{

			Object.add(int index, Object element)

		}
		
	b) Write an algorithm for deleting data from an array so that existing data is moved to close the gap made 
	   by the deleted data.
	
	
		for((int i = 0; i < Object.width;i ++))

		{

			Object.remove(2);

		}
	
6. How does passing an entire array to a method differ from passing a single element of the array?

		Passing a whole array allows the method to access an element of the array and change its value. 
		While passing a single element only passes the data stored, and not a reference to the data location.
	
7. Why are offset array indexes required in some cases.

		Offset array indexes are required in some cases because then you can store large numbers for a counter 
		in your program. 
		
		For example, 
		
		for (int index = offset; index < size; index++) 
		{
		
    		sum += arr[index];
    		
		}


		for (int offset = index; offset < size; offset++) 
		{
		
    
    		sum += arr[offset];
    
		}

8. What output is displayed by the statements below?

String name = “Elaine”;
System.out.println(name.charAt(3));

E: 0
l: 1
a: 2
i: 3
n: 4
e: 5
