1. Data can be in memory because it is a form of medium that can be used to store data from the user and programmer. 

2. There can be three different ways to import packages from the one in the file or another package, that it can do to 
   require access to the File Class in an application. They are without importing the package, import package with a 
   specific class at hand or importing a package with all classes. 

	For example:

		import.java.io*;
		import pack.Test;
		import.java.util.Scanner;
		import.java.sql.io;
		import testerReally.*;

3. The error is the file name at the beginning of the statement, where it should be just the .txt file name inside the 
   package because then it’ll be faster to prompt the user and find the file without the C:/ Users that make it private 
   only for the computer at hand and not on another. 

4. 

	a) “Catch” is the statement used to write an exception handler. 
	b) Write an exception handler to handle an IOException if a specified file name cannot be used to create a file. 
	   The exception handler should display appropriate messages to the user.

	catch (IOException e)

		{

			System.out.println(Problem Creating File.”);
			System.err.println(“IOException: “ + e.getMessage());

		}

5. 
	a) The stream name for displaying error messages is “An exception handler”.
	b) And this stream name will display when an error occurs in the code, normally the error tab or when the user begins the program and doesn’t work.
